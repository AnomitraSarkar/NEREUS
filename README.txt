frontend language = python
backend language =  mysql and csv
main files = home_manager.py, municipal_manager.py
other files = backup files, user_data files, monthly_bills files
development env = visual studio code

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

the two main files home manager.py and municipal manager are for two differenent ends
the municipal manager is for the authority end and the home manager being the front end for the user.

on starting you can install the packages : mysql-connector-python, pyautogui, tabulate for full functioning of the software.

also if you're a new user and want to experiment with the software with soem experimental data, startup the municipal manager and use the backup data allready provided in the  same directory by selecting UPDATE FROM BACKUP from BACKUP SETTINGS.

after the above you can go an experiment the real life simulation of  this IOT  Water Management System.

payment methods are not included in the payment_redirect methods, as this is just a trial software. 
the only vulnerability this software has is "mysql-insertion", as this software is using mysql as backend.

if running the code run it directly in cmd or as an exe file. running in a idle with a formatter can reassemble the installationa and import order resulting in an error.
